    "mainDescription": "Two Fifty Co. was founded as an answer to the question: 'How can we make coworking better?' For many years now, our team has traveled around the world visiting coworking spaces and meeting their peoples, over 1000 at the moment. Over time, organizations began to ask us to teach them about how coworking is done around the globe. While working with clients on specific projects, we constantly asked ourselves how to expand our impact on coworking in general. Our most important advice to coworking spaces has always been to work closely with their members. To stress this point, we started Hack Coworking, an event where members can invent the products and services they need in shared workspaces, providing direct feedback to coworking spaces on what to focus their services on. We also embarked on a journey to create a book with unique content that cannot be found through a simple Google search. In addition to our consulting work, we also build and manage the most popular job board for people passionate about participating in the biggest change to the office as we know it.",

We organize practical workshops, presentations, and educational events for a range of organizations. Additionally, we consult with companies operating or aspiring to start coworking spaces, offering support in concept development, organization, team building, and community engagement.",
      "paragraph2": "Our journey began in 2014. At that time, Pauline managed a 2000 sq/m coworking space in Berlin, and Dimitar was involved in a startup accelerator within that space. This collaboration led to the creation of Coworkies.com, the first job board targeted at coworking spaces. We also hosted the first coworking hackathon in London and authored a book detailing our experiences with over 500 coworking spaces in 50 cities globally.",
      "paragraph3": "At TwoFifty, we actively organize and participate in coworking-related events. Our goal is to share our knowledge and experiences of coworking practices from around the world. As the workplace continues to evolve, we are dedicated to educating individuals and organizations about the benefits and possibilities of coworking."
